Materialize is a modern browser responsive Front-end CSS framework and base of google marital design. So here we made a button kit of Materialize CSS with the help of Materialize CSS background classes & also we used some basic CSS properties.

#Installation

'npm i materialize buttons palette kit --save'


Then....

   <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn red lighten-1">button</a>

......
