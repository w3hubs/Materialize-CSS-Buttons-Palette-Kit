
# What about this packgae?

Materialize is a modern browser responsive Front-end CSS framework and base of google marital design. So here we made a button kit of Materialize CSS with the help of Materialize CSS background classes & also we used some basic CSS properties.

# Installation
```
$ 'npm i materialize buttons palette kit --save'
```

Then....

"waves-effect waves-light btn red lighten-1"

......

In this kit, we used background color classes of Materialize CSS and also we used btn-small & btn-large too. Here we also modify one Materialize CSS class which is lighten-5 because in this class have text color properties is white, Which is not good to show. So here we used custom color which looks like black color. We donâ€™t use here a single line of media queries.
